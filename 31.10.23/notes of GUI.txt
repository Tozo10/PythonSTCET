1) Listener program. - tracks I/O devices. Active as long as machine is ON. Monitors entire coordinate area. 
Works on ECA model - (Event Condition Action)- event - click cond - clicked on words so words have to open words. - action - open the app

2)GUI  vs CLI

3) GUI - generate layout -> incorporate OS -> listener-> object -> write underlying program

4) Buttons/ command buttons - data provided , just click on it for some actions.

5) output should be done in labels as we do not want to change the o/p. Txt box - txt can be changed, labels are constant

6) radio button - Use frames(as helps in making group) before making

7) list box- disadvant. - Large list need to scroll down and use a lot of space so use combo boxes(drop down list box). Combo - list box + txt box. 
          ex - message box, input box.
